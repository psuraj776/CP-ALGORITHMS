When we have to get a^n.
Naive way is a*a*a*a*a*a....... n times
Binary exponentiation is if power is even then answer would be a^(n/2) * a^(n/2), else if power is odd then answer would be a * a^(n-1)
There is another way
for example 
2^10

Here 10 can we written in form 1010
  1     0     1    0
a^8   a^4   a^2

Application:
1. Effective computation of large exponents modulo a number.
2. Effective computation of Fibonacci numbers.
3. Applying a permutation  $k$  times.
4. Fast application of a set of geometric operations to a set of points.
5. Number of paths of length  $k$  in a graph.
6. Variation of binary exponentiation: multiplying two numbers modulo  $m$.
