When we have to get a^n.
Naive way is a*a*a*a*a*a....... n times
Binary exponentiation is if power is even then answer would be a^(n/2) * a^(n/2), else if power is odd then answer would be a * a^(n-1)
There is another way
for example 
2^10

Here 10 can we written in form 1010
  1     0     1    0
a^8   a^4   a^2
